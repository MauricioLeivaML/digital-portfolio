```{tab-item} Things I learned
- Book editing is quite flexible, which allows working with a variety of content. I found it to be a tool with enormous potential, and I will definitely include it in my work routine.
- Another important item I learned is how to better understand the interaction between files that make up the book.
- BTW, thank you for the links you included in the assignment; they were all useful.
```

```{tab-item} Things I found difficult
- When I was rebuilding my book and encountered issues, it was challenging to find a solution. 
- Another task that was particularly challenging was adding a link with an image and getting it to display properly in the book.. although it sounds simple, I spent many time..
